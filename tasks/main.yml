# TODO: The container ip retrieval is missing
# TODO : Maybe IP forwarding needs to be forced to 1 every time.
# TODO : I had to manually connect the container to the bridge network with docker network connect bridge openvpn-app to get the ip.
# TODO: And then after inspecting I got the ip for the command below
#
# - name: Add container route for the ip pool
#   shell:
#   cmd: ip route add 192.168.255.0/24 via 172.17.0.2 dev docker0

# - name: Add container route for the static ips
